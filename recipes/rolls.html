    <h1>Pepperoni Rolls</h1>
    <img src="rolls.jpeg" alt="Pepperoni Rolls">
    <p>Pepperoni rolls are a dish that's near and dear to me. My grandfather taught
        me how to make them. They were a staple in his childhood and definitely 
        were in mine as well. It's a perfect but simple food. The pepperoni gives it
        a nice kick, the mozzarella compliments the pepperoni, and it's all contained
        in a nice flaky roll. It also goes well with a nce side of Marinara sauce for
        dipping!
    </p>
    <p>Pro Tip: If you're in a cooking mood. The vodka sauce I have listed on here
        is a even better companion for the pepperoni rolls as well. Try it, you won't 
        regret it.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>One pound of pizza dough</li>
        <li>Eight ounces of Pepperoni</li>
        <li>Eight ounces of full fat Mozzarella</li>
        <li>Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>Garlic powder</li>
        <li>Three tablespoons of melted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Flour a cutting board and roll out your dough into a rectangle.</li>
        <li>Season your dough with Italian seasoning and Garlic powder.</li>
        <li>Slice Pepperoni and Mozzarella. Shingle your pepperoni on the dough in rows. In between your 
            pepperoni rows put a row of mozzarella. Do that until your dough 
            is covered.</li>
        <li>Roll your dough up (kinda like a carpet).</li>
        <li>Put it on a baking sheet. Put it in the oven at 400 degrees and bake 
            until the dough is golden brown.</li>
        <li>When the rolls are done brush the melted butter on the rolls and 
            let them sit for 5 minutes. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
