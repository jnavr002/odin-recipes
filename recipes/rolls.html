    <p>Pepperoni rolls are a dish that's near and dear to me. My grandfather taught
        me how to make them. They were a staple in his childhood and definitely 
        were in mine as well. It's a perfect but simple food. The pepperoni gives it
        a nice kick, the mozzarella compliments the pepperoni, and it's all contained
        in a nice flaky roll. It also goes well with a nce side of Marinara sauce for
        dipping!

    <p>Pro Tip: If you're in a cooking mood. The vodka sauce I have listed on here
        is a even better companion for the pepperoni rolls as well. Try it, you won't 
        regret it.
