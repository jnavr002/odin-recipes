    <h1>Vodka Sauce with Penne Pasta</h1>
    <img src="pasta.jpg" alt="Pasta Picture">
    <p>Growing up with an Italian mother, pasta and sauce was always a consistent 
        staple in our house but in my mind there was always one pasta dish to rule
        them all: Vodka Sauce with Penne Pasta. Vodka sauce is very rich and heavy. It can
        be spicy, fragrant, garlic-y, or all of them at once, it can be whatever you
        want you just have to change the ratio of the ingredients to your liking! Since it's a heavy sauce it pairs very well with Penne noodles as well.
        It's a simple and quick recipe. All you need is a few ingredients and a big 
        appetite!</p>
